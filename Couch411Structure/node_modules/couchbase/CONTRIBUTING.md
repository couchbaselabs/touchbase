We've decided to use "gerrit" for our code review system, making it
easier for all of us to contribute with code and comments.

  1. Visit http://review.couchbase.org and "Register" for an account
  2. Review http://review.couchbase.org/static/individual_agreement.html
  3. Agree to agreement by visiting http://review.couchbase.org/#/settings/agreements
  4. If you do not receive an email, please contact us
  5. Check out the couchnode area http://review.couchbase.org/#/q/status:open+project:couchnode,n,z
  6. Join us on IRC at #libcouchbase on Freenode :-)

There is a pretty tight relationship between our Node.js driver
development and the development of libcouchbase, so for now you have
to run the latest versions of both projects to be sure that everything
works. I have however made it easy for you to develop on couchstore by
using a repo manifest file. If you haven't done so already you should
download the repo from http://code.google.com/p/git-repo/downloads/list
and put it in your path. Alternatively, you can also contribute using
pure git by following http://review.couchbase.org/Documentation/user-upload.html

All you should need to set up your development environment should be:

    trond@ok ~> mkdir sdk
    trond@ok ~> cd sdk
    trond@ok ~/sdk> repo init -u git://github.com/trondn/manifests.git -m sdk.xml
    trond@ok ~/sdk> repo sync
    trond@ok ~/sdk> repo start my-branch-name --all
    trond@ok ~/sdk> gmake nodejs

This will build the latest version of libcouchbase and the couchnode
driver. You must have a C and C++ compiler installed, automake,
autoconf, node and v8.

If you have to make any changes in libcouchbase or couchnode,
just commit them before you upload them to gerrit with the
following command:

    trond@ok ~/sdk> repo upload

You might experience a problem trying to upload the patches if you've
selected a different login name at review.couchbase.org than your login
name. Don't worry, all you need to do is to add the following to your
~/.gitconfig file:

    [review "review.couchbase.org"]
            username = trond

I normally don't go looking for stuff in gerrit, so you should add at
least Brett Lawson (brett19@gmail.com) as a reviewer for your patch.
He'll know who else to add and add them for you.
