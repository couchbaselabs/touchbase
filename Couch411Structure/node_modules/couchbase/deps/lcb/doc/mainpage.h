/**
 * @page lcb_thrsafe Thread Safety
 *
 * The library uses no internal locking and is thus not safe to be used
 * concurrently from multiple threads. As the library contains no globals
 * you may call into the library from multiple threads so long as the same data
 * structure (specifically, the same `lcb_t`) is not used.
 *
 * @include doc/example/threads.c
 *
 * In this quick mockup example, the same `lcb_t` is being used from multiple
 * threads and thus requires locking. Now if each thread created its own `lcb_t`
 * it would be free to operate upon it without locking.
