/**
 * Here is the internal API for the durability functions.

 * Durability works on polling multiple observe responses and waiting until a
 * key (or set of keys) have either been persisted, or the wait period has
 * expired.
 *
 * The operation maintains an internal counter which counts how many keys
 * do not have a conclusive observe response yet (i.e. how many do not have
 * their criteria satisfied yet). The operation is considered complete when
 * the counter reaches 0.
